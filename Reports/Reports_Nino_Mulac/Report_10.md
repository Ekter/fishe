# Tenth report -- 21/1/2023


## shell

I printed an empty version of the shell, and I will try to fill it with expansive moss to prevent water from entering the shell even if it broke, while being lighter than the shell with the filling.
I have tested the raspberry pi pico and it works perfectly as a web server, so I will be able to use it only as a web interface to send data to the Jetson hosting the server.
I have started to learn how to use Isaac Sim, so maybe I will be able to use it to simulate the robot and the probe, and to test the code before using it on the real robot.
