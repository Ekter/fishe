# Fourth report -- 28/10/2022

Task according to the Gantt chart :

* Shells impression + test

I printed a shorter version of the shell(only 20 cm, the final shell should be 30 cm long) because I need to print it vertically, and the printers can only make models up to around 25 cm long vertically

## Water drag test

video of the test shell(depending on your browser, I think you might need to download it):

We can see that the shell has almost no drag, even fully emerged, compared to a full shell (the shell in the other angle). The shell is also very light, so it's a good thing.

I modelised a different design for the shell's front part. I want it to be asymetric. I used a loft, to make the structure continuous and smooth. But even with a high impression precision(0.10 mm), the impression is a bit rough. I will maybe try to resin it.

## Shock resistance

The boat will move approximately up to 1m/s, so I need to test the shock resistance of the shell. I have done so by tring to bend it, on all axes. The shell is very resistant, I can only compress it a bit on the middle, and that's not a problem thanks to the PETG's elasticity.

I have also tested to throw it at different speeds way over 1m/s, and it didn't break.

I think I can say it is though enough.
