# Seventh report -- 9/12/2022

Task according to the Gantt chart :

* Simples designs impression + assembly

I finally managed to print the seals, ans have dedicated this session to the shell's assembly.
The problem is the seals.
I made them to fit in the shells, without any gap, but with an angle of 10Â°.

The black line and above is the shell, the rectangle in the grey surface and below is the seal.
So there should be enough space for the seal to fit in the shell, but it doesn't.
In fact, the problem isn't that the seal doesn't fit in, but that its supports doesn't want to get into the shell.
Since the seals are flexible, the supports bows themselves, compress themselves, and just lay next to the shell's hole without getting in, because of the pressure.
