# Sixth report -- 28/10/2022

Task according to the Gantt chart :

* Simples designs around the shell

I still have some shell problems, because I can only print it with the volumic printer, and it can't print the little holes I made in the shell correctly. In fact, the problem was my design : I made a little wall with a thickness of 0.2, and I printed it with a duct of 0.4 with the Prusa printer. PrusaSlicer was able to put a wire to make the wall, but the Volumic slicer can't do it. So I couldn't print the holes in the volumic printer, I had to fill the entire shell to make it strong enough. The problem is the weight of the filling... With the holes, my shell weights 175g, with 10% filling, it weights 225g. I hope these 50g won't be too much, otherwise I will be forced to modify the shell's shape.

I have printed one of the two shells, and its two noses. I will have to block the volumic printer another week end to print everything else...
