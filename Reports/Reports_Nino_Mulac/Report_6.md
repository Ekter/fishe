# Sixth report -- 6/12/2022

Task according to the Gantt chart :

* Simples designs around the shell

I still have some shell problems, because I can only print it with the volumic printer, and it can't print the little holes I made in the shell correctly. In fact, the problem was my design : I made a little wall with a thickness of 0.2, and I printed it with a duct of 0.4 with the Prusa printer. PrusaSlicer was able to put a wire to make the wall, but the Volumic slicer can't do it. So I couldn't print the holes in the volumic printer, I had to fill the entire shell to make it strong enough. The problem is the weight of the filling... With the holes, my shell weights 175g, with 10% filling, it weights 225g. I hope these 50g won't be too much, otherwise I will be forced to modify the shell's shape.

I have printed one of the two shells, and its two noses. I will have to block the volumic printer another week end to print everything else...

I have gone to the international convention "Méditerranée du Futur" in Marseille, and I have been able to discuss from my project with some people.

Firstly, my attention was drawn by an firm making water cleaning robots. They consist of catamaran with a net between their shells. They can catch a lot of garbage loke that, or it is possible to fill the net with an hydrocarbon absorber to help after oil spills for example. They can also work in collaboration to draw a bigger net. This robots were interesting because they are supposed to be in use for long periods, and must therefore be autonomous. But they aren't able to turn over yet if they tip over after hitting a rock for example, altough they are almost a meter long. I would like my robot to be longer too, to be more stable.

The second notable encounter was with a firm making analysis buoy, equipped with a lot of different sensors. After discussing a while, I learned that the quantity of dissolved oxygen in the water can be very interesting to know, because it can be a good indicator of the health of the water. I will have to look into that. Plus, I could give them my data, because they could be interested in it. They told me about [Aqualabo](https://en.aqualabo.fr/), a firm making sensors for water analysis. I will have to look into that too.
