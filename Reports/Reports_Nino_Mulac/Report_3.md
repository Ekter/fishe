Third report -- 28/10/2022
==========================

Task according to the Gantt chart :

* Shells design

Last week, I modeled the catamaran shell, like this :

But I thought of a better idea for the shells, since they need to be light and strong. I decided to make them empty, and add an other shell inside. So, if the outside shell breaks, the boat will still float. So I had to find a way to connect the two shells together, and I decided to use little circular connectors.

The circles placement is important, since it will link the two shells.
